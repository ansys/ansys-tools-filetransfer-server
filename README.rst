Filetransfer Tool Server
========================

The Filetransfer Tool is a minimal gRPC API for transferring files between a client and a remote server.

This code is the server component of the Filetransfer Tool.

**WARNING**:

The Filetransfer Tool does not provide any security measures. Any file
on the server component can be accessed by any client. Without additional security
measures, it is unsuited for use over an untrusted network.
